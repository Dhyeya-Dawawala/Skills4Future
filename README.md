# Comprehensive Air Pollution Analysis Project

## Overview
This project, developed for my ML internship, analyzes air pollution using two real-world datasets. The primary goals were to perform exploratory data analysis, build a predictive machine learning model, and present the findings in an interactive web application.

## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations showing global pollution hotspots and category distributions.
- **Machine Learning Model:** A Random Forest Classifier that predicts the Air Quality Index (AQI) Category based on individual pollutant levels.
- **Interactive Web App:** A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit that allows users to get real-time predictions from the trained model.

## How to Run the Web App
1.  Ensure you have Python installed.
2.  Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn joblib
    ```
3.  Run the application from your terminal:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
